Project Overview

### 

Overview

There are a lot of data generated on the internet every day, including those generated by applications, those generated by behaviors and those generated by machines. Through the management and analysis of the data, we can discover the tremendous value contained in the data, and understand and insight into the internal operation of the transaction.Big data has become a means of human understanding of the world, and data is constantly changing people's lifestyles, economic rules and business models, and even driving innovation and change in the entire economy.

Based on the global blockchain node network resources, a highly configurable but easy to operate data acquisition robot and data asset transaction network is created to maximize data mining and data value.

The robot of finddata node is used to mine the original data. The collected data is purified and uploaded to the cloud, and then the data operation center is triggered by the business server to run. Through statistics, online analysis and processing, information retrieval, machine learning, expert system (relying on the past rules of thumb) and pattern recognition, the mined data is modeled and analyzed, so as to improve the efficiency.Get effective value data and store it in the data server, or the client can download and save it locally as needed.

The obtained data can be hashed on the blockchain and traded on the blockchain as an asset. The standard and value setting of data interaction is completed by smart contract. The data trading platform will be built on the substrate of Polkadot.  All participants in data mining, including contribution server, proxy IP, bandwidth, collection rule algorithm and contribution data, can get Token-based rewards, while the demander or user of data needs to pay Token to get the data.

### 

Integration

FindData is composed of a distributed data acquisition engine and a trading center on the big data chain. The data in the real world are mined and analyzed to form valuable assets, which can be bought and sold freely on the chain. The behaviors and values in the economy are linked by tokens.

Project Details

### 

Token

#### 

FDN

FindData Network tokenloosely represent the value of theFindDatanetwork.

Any FindData economy that participates in data-related activities will receive the token. Contains the following economic behaviors: server contribution, proxy IP, bandwidth, collection rule algorithm, data contribution.

### 

Contract

Minner

Initial tokens can be obtained by providing liquidity through Trands mining, or tokens can be purchased through transactions. They can be pledged to the FindData network and become operational nodes. The FindData Robot can be deployed in its own network and contribute servers, proxy IP and bandwidth to carry out big data mining so as to obtain effective data and get Token rewards. Minner takes the data and makes it available for his own use, or hashes it up to DataWap and trades it so that more people can download the data.

Smarter

By optimizing acquisition rules algorithm,make the system become more effective and the value of diversity, smarter algorithm, submitted will be graded by the dao commission approved online, after the adoption of the new node algorithm, obtained data mining will get more benefit, smarter reward will be Token by using the algorithm of node to transfer5% of the distribution.

### 

Pools

FindData Robot

FindData Robot is a distributed big data acquisition engine distributed in each FindData node. The node needs to hold FDNsfor pledge to obtain the node authority. The Robot adopts Spark, a popular solution for real-time big data analysis and mining, as well as Hadoop, a popular solution for big data storage and operation.

Dataswap

DataSwap is a distributed big data trading center established on Substrate. The value data obtained by users are packaged and linked, and the initial pricing is formed based on the smart contract standard. All the linked data can be traded freely on DataSwap.

### 

Token Distribution

1 billion FDNs will be issued, 100 million forLiquiditymanagement, 220 million for team motivation,180 million for early investors, 350 million for node rewards, and150 millionfor community governance. Theforthyear began to issue8%, thefifithyear to issue7%... Up to the tenth year of3% additional issue, thereafter each year3% additional issue, part of the additional issue as a nodal award issued.

### 

Ecosystem Fit

In FindData2.0, the scope of data collection will be extended to the entire blockchain, and all the data on the chain will be given higher value.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can build one of our substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 80%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests. | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. |  
| 1. | Robot Module | Create a highly configurable but easy to operate data acquisition robot and data asset transaction network. |  
| 2. | Network module | Developing a cross blockchain data asset trading network, and build a web system platform for user. |
